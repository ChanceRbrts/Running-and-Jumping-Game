Running-and-Jumping-Game
========================

Well... This is a Java "Platformer" that I am working on. You can not stop running or jumping no matter what you do.
That's... not entirely true. You can press Z or Space to stop running and X or Up to stop jumping...
You can also use the arrow keys to change your direction...
Besides that, it's also glitchy, with bad double-buffering.

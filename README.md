Running-and-Jumping-Game
========================

Well... This is a Java Platformer that came up at a conversation with Lord of Binary. 
You can not stop running or jumping.
...Unless you can press Z or Space to stop running and X or Up to stop jumping...
You can also use the arrow keys to change your direction...
Besides that, it's also glitchy, with bad double-buffering.
